        The Unitary Fund is a non-profit that is helping create a quantum technology ecosystem that
        benefits the most people. [<a href="http://bit.ly/unitaryfund2">Blogpost Announcement</a>]
    </p>

    <p class="blocktext">
        We do two main things:
    </p>
    <ul class="blocktext">
        <li>We run a microgrant program that funds explorers across the world to work on quantum technologies. Do you
            have an idea for a project in quantum technology?
            <b><a href="https://willzeng.typeform.com/to/j0kAOd" target="_blank" style="background-color:yellow">Apply
                for a microgrant here.</a></b></li>
        <li>We do our own research in-house on projects that help the ecosystem as a whole. <b>We're now hiring for a
            new quantum software project. <a href="jobs/mts.html" style="background-color:yellow">Apply to be a Member
                of our Technical Staff here.</a></b></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="blocktext">

        Our grant program gives <b>$4k</b> cash grants for projects that aim to develop the quantum technology
        ecosystem. This could be open source quantum software, educational materials and workshops, a new quantum
        sensor prototype, or much more.

        Through our supportive partners, applicants now also have the option of getting free credits to run on
        Rigetti's <a href="https://www.rigetti.com/qcs">Quantum Cloud Services</a> and
        priority-tier access to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/technology/systems">IBMQ's publicly
        available devices.</a>
    </p>

    <p class="blocktext">
        Our program is designed to be as simple as possible. No committees to convince. No organizational affiliation
        required. Just a short form and a two minute video. For more information

        The Unitary Fund is designed to help the quantum industry, in a small way, to cross the chasm. We started as a
        small microgrant program for open source quantum software projects

    <p class="subtitle">F.A.Q.</p>

    <p class="blocktext">
        <b>Q: Can anyone apply?</b> <br>
        Yes - any age, any country, no credentials required.<br><br>

        <b>Q: What type of project qualifies?</b> <br>
        Any project that will benefit humanity that leverages or supports quantum technology. Open source and/or open
        publication is not a dogmatic requirement - though we would recommend it as a starting point. It is, however,
        important to see a rationale for any exceptions (for example if you think it'd be best for the world to
        reserve the IP for a company).<br><br>

        <b>Q: Is there a duration for projects?</b> <br>
        We would prefer projects to be completed within 3-6 months. However, if there is a reason that your project
        should have a longer time window then include that in your application and we will consider it.<br><br>

        <b>Q: What do I get if I win?</b> <br>
        We'll give you cash 50% up front. We'll check in with you during the project before sending the second half.
        Then we'll do a follow-up phone call and/or email at the end to hear how it went. Payment will come by Paypal or
        wire transfer. <br><br>

        Additionally, in your application you can mark if you'd like to receive access to Rigetti QCS and IBMQ. If you
        are selected for a grant then you will get this access as well.<br><br>

        We'll publish a list of all the winners on <a href="http://unitary.fund" target="_blank">unitary.fund</a> after
        they've been selected. At completion we'll ask you to submit a short summary of the project that can be posted online.

        During the project, you don't need to make regular reports on your progress (though we'd be happy to hear
        from you). <br><br>

        <b>Q: What are the key dates?</b> <br>
        There are no key dates! Applications are rolling until all grant money has been allocated. <br><br>

        <b>Q: What kind of projects are you looking for?</b> <br>
        Quantum technology is a nascent field, so we're open-minded. Your project can be:
    </p>
    <ul class="blocktext">
        <li>contributing to an existing open source project</li>
        <li>creating a new framework or tool</li>
        <li>researching a new algorithm</li>
        <li>building a quantum hardware prototype</li>
        <li>running a new workshop or course</li>
        <li>applying an existing algorithm to a new problem</li>
        <li>creating or curating a free dataset that others can use</li>
        <li>educating, explaining, or otherwise helping people learn new or existing techniques</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="blocktext">
        …or anything else that feels like it would help make quantum technology useful faster.<br><br>

        In some cases, in particular for projects involving hardware, we know that our grant likely won't be enough
        for the whole project. We're happen for our grant to supplement existing work, though we would like to see
        justification in your application for why the project could use our support.<br><br>

        <b>Q: How will you select the winners?</b> <br>
        We're looking for smart people with interesting ideas that could be useful to the world. We pay extra
        attention to projects that seem like they won't get funded another way. <br><br>

        <b>Q: I have a job. Can I still apply?</b> <br>
        Yes! Anyone can apply. You just need to make sure that you don't conflict with any IP contract you've signed
        with your employer. <br><br>

        <b>Q: Can teams apply?</b> <br>
        Yes. Multiple people can apply together as a team. Please fill out a single application, but provide background
        information for each person in the team. You should designate a lead person to coordinate the application as
        well as receive and distribute/spend the money. <br><br>

        <b>Q: Can I apply multiple times?</b> <br>
        Yes, you can apply as often as you like. You can win multiple times and we will consider repeat funding to
        continue to grow a project to the next level.<br><br>

        <b>Q: I love this idea and I want to help! Can I provide additional funding, datasets, mentorship, or help
            reviewing applications?</b> <br>
        Yes! Thank you for being awesome! If you want to contribute in any way, please email me at
        <a href="mailto:contribute@unitary.fund">contribute@unitary.fund</a>.<br><br>

        <b>Q: Are there any strings attached?</b> <br>
        The money is a gift. It's not an equity investment or loan, and we won't own any of your intellectual property.
        Our only request is that you think about how to pay it forward to others.<br><br>
