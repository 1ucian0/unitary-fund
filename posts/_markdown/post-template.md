We are excited to share the results for the 2022 Quantum Open Source Software (OSS) Survey organized by Unitary Fund. Collectively, over 1000 responses were provided by the community to the main software survey (Part I) and to the community survey on Diversity & Inclusion (Part II).

You can find the results below and at [this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRjda57eKp7sLZENSJ7x83To2r0ja7XmW5sYaEobmYlvDKw122gagKm1j_qYm820054VbpFL0zZGjug/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).

Part I of the survey was divided into the following sections:

- Demographics
- Experience
-- Cloud services
-- Full-stack development platforms and simulators
-- Software for applications and tools
- OSS Development & Research
- Community

Let's highlight some of the most interesting results
